<b>Reaction Wheel Stabilized Inverted Pendulum</b>
<p><i>Inspiration</i></p>
<p>Embed Youtube Video</p>
<br>
<p><i>Goals</i></p>
<p>After seeing that video I wanted to learn more about this reaction wheel stabilized
system and get some basic experience designing control algorithms. With the added desire
to brush up on my EE skills I decided to embark on an effort to build the following:<br>
- reaction wheel stabilization module for inverted pendulums (no swing up)<br>
- LQR optimal control algorithm with quaternion based attitude specification<br>
- brushless DC motors for reaction wheel torque<br>
- battery powered electronics on PCB in small form factor<br>
<br>
While performing the initial research I realized there were a <i>few</i> more things I'd need
to learn:<br>
- physics simulation in software<br>
- state space representation of equations<br>
- optimal control theory<br>
- motor selection<br>
- brushless DC motor control<br>
- C++ (or a least a major refresher)<br>
- CAD design<br>
- machining of parts<br>
<br>
With a strong will, open source software, access to research papers, and a friend with
a machine shop I got started...</p>
<br>

<p><i>Controller Design</i></p>
<p>I performed this part in two stages: (1) single rotation axis with euler angles and
(2) full three axis control with quaternions. Each control algorthim utilized an LQR 
controller. In the first stage I wrote my first LQR controller and simulated the physics
in 2D space. Adapting some code by [link]toddisfleet, I was able to create a visualization of 
the inverted pendulum and the one reaction wheel that stabilized it.

The next stage was implementing 3-axis stabilization using quaternions and LQR controller.
Particularly useful in [Yang 2010] was the reduction of number of quaternions from 4 
terms to 3 terms and a few linearizations. The simulation below shows a top-down view of the
inverted pendulum recovering from an initial offset.
